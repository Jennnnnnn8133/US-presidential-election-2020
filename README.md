# US-presidential-election-2020
## Motivation

In the 2020 presidential election, the ten major swing states deserve more attention. It is also the place that attracts the most attention to the latest developments in a US presidential election campaign. Through the Voice of America electoral vote statistics, we can also observe the changes in the number of votes obtained by the two major parties in the past presidential elections in the traditional swing states and the differences in traditional iron votes. The re-elected Republican and President Donald Trump and the Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden have seen fierce battles in these ten traditional swing states.

## Analysis
In recent years, Arizona’s demographic structure has changed that many liberal voters especially young people have settled here because of the low cost of living. Also, the state is close to the US-Mexico border, and a large number of Latino population has entered and occupied the state. Nearly one-third of the state’s population which coupled with the increase in the population of Phoenix and its suburbs, and accounts for more than half of the state’s population. All these make the Democrats see the hope of turning over and win in this state because Trump won only 3.5 percentage points in Arizona in 2016. 
After looking over the data, I started to wonder about the correlation between 2016 and 2020 election, there was a positive correlation between the level of education and whether to support democracy. Many Trump supporters did not receive a college education.
